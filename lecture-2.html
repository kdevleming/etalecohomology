<dd class="math">
<p>A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> is a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> with a collection of coverings <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}{i\in I}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(U\in C\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Any isomorphism is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering, and for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we have a covering <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U_i\}\)</span>, the total collection <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering and <span class="math">\(V\to U\)</span> is arbitrary, then each <span class="math">\(U_i\times_U V\)</span> exists and <span class="math">\(\{U_i\times V\to V\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>

What about letting <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of <em>schemes</em>, and taking coverings to be collections of maps <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is scheme-theoretically surjective.

Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of <span class="math">\(C^\infty\)</span>-manifolds, and say that a covering is a collection of submersions <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is surjective. One funny quirk: a submersion has local sections everywhere. Does this mean that this topology can be compared to the classical one somehow? For example, do they have the same sheaves?

<p>We can modify the above example: fix a manifold <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and define the category of interest to be maps of manifolds <span class="math">\(Y\to X\)</span> that are everywhere local isomorphisms. This is equivalent to the statement that the tangent map is an isomorphism everywhere.</p>
