<h1 id="grothendieck-topologies-presheaves-and-sheaves">Grothendieck topologies, presheaves, and sheaves</h1>
<p>Recall the definition of a Grothendieck topology.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <em>Grothendieck topology</em> is a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> with a collection of coverings <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}{i\in I}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(U\in C\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Any isomorphism is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering, and for each <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we have a covering <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U_i\}\)</span>, the total collection <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a covering and <span class="math">\(V\to U\)</span> is arbitrary, then each <span class="math">\(U_i\times_U V\)</span> exists and <span class="math">\(\{U_i\times V\to V\}\)</span> is a covering.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: we have to let <span class="math">\(i=j\)</span> in the above!!!</p>
<p>A category with a Grothendieck topology is often called a <em>site</em>.</p>
<div class="example">
The category of open subsets of a topological space is a Grothendieck topology in a natural way.
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of sets, and suppose a covering <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> is a collection of maps whose union is surjective. Let’s check the three properties.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An isomorphism is surjective.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(A=\cup B_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B_i = \cup D_{ij}\)</span>, then certainly <span class="math">\(A=\cup D_{ij}\)</span>. Now apply this to images.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(A\to B\)</span> is a surjective map of sets and <span class="math">\(D\to B\)</span> is arbitrary, then <span class="math">\(A\times_B D\to D\)</span> is surjective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="example">
What about letting <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of <em>schemes</em>, and taking coverings to be collections of maps <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is scheme-theoretically surjective. Does this work? (If you feel weird, use varieties or some such thing.)
</div>
<div class="example">
Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the category of <span class="math">\(C^\infty\)</span>-manifolds, and say that a covering is a collection of submersions <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is surjective. One funny quirk: a submersion has local sections everywhere. Does this mean that this topology can be compared to the classical one somehow? For example, do they have the same sheaves? (What is a sheaf?)
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We can modify the above example: fix a manifold <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and define the category of interest to be maps of manifolds <span class="math">\(Y\to X\)</span> that are everywhere local isomorphisms. This is equivalent to the statement that the tangent map is an isomorphism everywhere.</p>
<p>Why is this closed under fiber products? What else do we have to check?</p>
Let’s call this the <em>small submersion topology</em>.
</div>
<div class="example">
Given any Grothendieck topology on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and an object <span class="math">\(X\in\C\)</span>, we get one on the slice category <span class="math">\(C_{/X}\)</span>, by working relative to <span class="math">\(X\)</span> everywhere. What are the coverings of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in this topology?
</div>
<h3 id="the-canonical-topology">The canonical topology</h3>
<p>Every category comes with a <em>canonical</em> topology.</p>
<div class="definition">
A <em>universal effective epimorphism</em> in a category <span class="math">\(C\)</span> that admits fiber products is a map <span class="math">\(X\to Y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span> such that for all <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>, the diagram <span class="math">\[\Hom(X,Z)\to\Hom(Y,Z)\rightrightarrows\Hom(Y\times_X Y, Z)\]</span> is exact.
</div>
<div class="definition">
The <em>canonical topology</em> on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is the topology with coverings given by collections of maps <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sqcup U_i\to U\)</span> is a universal effective epimorphism.
</div>
<h3 id="presheaves-and-sheaves">Presheaves and sheaves</h3>
<p>Now we can mimic the old (categorical) definitions! Fix a category <span class="math">\(S\)</span> that is closed under products (for example, sets, abelian groups, rings, schemes, sheaves on a fixed topological space, etc.).</p>
<div class="definition">
A <em>presheaf</em> on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> with values in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a functor <span class="math">\[F:C^\circ\to S.\]</span>
</div>
<div class="definition">
A presheaf <span class="math">\(F:C^\circ\to S\)</span> is a <em>sheaf</em> if for every covering <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span>, the diagram <span class="math">\[F(U)\to\prod F(U_i)\rightrightarrows\prod F(U_i\times_U U_j)\]</span> is exact.
</div>
<div class="example">
In the canonical topology on <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, the functor <span class="math">\(h_X:C^\circ\to\Set\)</span> is a sheaf. (Why?)
</div>
<div class="exercise">
Is the canonical topology the “smallest” topology such that every representable functor is a sheaf? Is it the “largest”? Is it anythingest?
</div>
<h3 id="example-the-sheaves-on-the-submersion-topology-of-a-manifold">Example: the sheaves on the “submersion topology” of a manifold</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C\)</span> be the small submersion topology of a manifold <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Among the objects of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> are the open subsets <span class="math">\(U\subset X\)</span>; open coverings of open sets are coverings in the small submersion topology.</p>
<div class="claim">
Restricting to the subcategory of open subsets of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> gives an equivalence between sheaves of sets on <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and sheaves on the topological space of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>. Any covering <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> can be covered as <span class="math">\(\{V_{ij}\to U_i\}\)</span> such that each <span class="math">\(V_{ij}\to X\)</span> is an open embedding. QED</p>
<div class="exercise">
What are the universal effective epimorphisms in the category <span class="math">\(C\)</span>?
</div>
<h3 id="morphisms-of-topologies">Morphisms of topologies</h3>
<p>Now that we have our categorical analogue of topological spaces, how do we simulate continuous maps?</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Given categories <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C&#39;\)</span> with Grothendieck topologies, a <em>morphism of topologies</em> is a functor <span class="math">\(F:C\to C&#39;\)</span> such that</p>
<ul>
<li>for every covering <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, the image <span class="math">\(\{F(U_i)\to F(U)\}\)</span> is a covering</li>
<li>for every covering <span class="math">\(\{U_i\to U\}\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and every morphism <span class="math">\(V\to U\)</span> in <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, the canonical map <span class="math">\[F(U_i\times_U V)\to F(U_i)\times_{F(U)} F(V).\]</span> (Special case of this condition: <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C&#39;\)</span> have fiber products and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> preserves them. This is equilavent to <span class="math">\(F\)</span> preserving finite limits, also sometimes called “continuous” – now you know why!)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Everybody’s favorite example: <span class="math">\(C=\Open(X)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(C&#39;=\Open(Y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is the pullback map induced from a continuous map <span class="math">\(Y\to X\)</span>.</p>
<div class="question">
Does a continuous map of topological spaces induce a morphism of <em>big</em> topologies? Does a morphism of big topologies always come from a continuous map of topological spaces?
